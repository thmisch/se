# somedit - some cool text editor.
somedit enables you to do cool text editing of your cool projects.

## (Planned) Features:
- simple by design
- syntax highlighting for *any* language
- terminal-based
- helix / kakoune / vim based keybindings
- integrated file viewer
- spell and grammar checking (auto language detect, check code comments, check for specified file types) 
- cool license

Somedit doesn't have all features under the sun - instead modify it to your 
liking if you find a feature is missing. (A pull request would be cool,
if you feel it'd be useful to others.)
